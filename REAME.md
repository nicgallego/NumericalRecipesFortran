# Numerical Recipes in Fortran

Didactic implementation by Nicolas Gallego

Basically, my goal is to take appart the code of this book and put it back togeter for didactical purposes, including
- experience with old/new fortran styles
- doxygen documentation for fortran
- practice a build system 
- collect information in the book and in the repos found to run the routines inside a test harness
- test different test drivers, like vegetables or something pure fortran, light weight.

A long way to go, nice goals to near and enjoy on my 'tiempo desocupado'

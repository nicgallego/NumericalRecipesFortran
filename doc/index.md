# Introduction {#ch_intro}

Welcome to my hobby project for learning Numerical Analysis. I intend to type the code as I read the book:

- "Numerical Recipes in Fortran, The Art of Scientific Computing", by William H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling and Brian P. Flanney. Cambridge University Press 1992. Second Edition.

I am learning Modern Fortran as well with this exercise. Even though the code of the book is mainly Fortran77, I have been using other newer books and sources to get the code working.

Special thanks to the developers of ChatGPT. It is being a great tool on top of Googling terms, to navigate through sparse documentations, and solution of technical issues. Also a very fun way of learning, it feels like having somebody to chat about your thoughts.

To the best of my understanding, I am not braking any copyright rule by this exercise. My interpretation of the licence of the code of the book is that as long as it is more that a textual copy or the original code it is considered a new production.

## My contributions

See this as a personal notebook of my journey through the topic in one side, but as a fully usable piece of software in the other side. I intent to learn by experience to be a better programmer, and to develop solid kraftmanship in software engineering. So I set from the beginning this repository with what I could see as basic infrastructure for the journey. 

- The unit tests of the functions are my contribution, I did not order nor plan to use the 'diskette drivers' mentioned in the book.
- Additionally I plan to check the claims by my own coding and running the suggested benchmarks, and expand on related topics as I go.

- I will keep the book chapters structure in the source organization, I would create a subfolder for each chapter, with a module in it containing the code presented in that chapter.

- The names of variables and interfaces would be documented using modern style, declaring each dummy argument with its intent and other attributes.

- If you happen to be studying the book as well, don't hesitate to join coding and discussing. Learning in groups is beneficial. If you have done the journey already and spot problems in my code, your feedback is appreciated.

At the time of this writting I have processed the material of the first chapter, preeliminaries, and spend the time and effort to setup the repository with its testing and documentation infrastructure. As the journey goes further, I plan to make release of the library. 

Numerical analysis is a mature area with lots of available software, so the code in this book and what I may implement based on its presentation may be naive in some cases, when possible I plan to compare the results and performace and document my findings as well.

I would also add short notes when necesary summarizing the results of the benchmarks and documenting my insights.

Thank you for reading.

# Documentation {#mainpage}


Welcome to my hobby project for learning Numerical Analysis. I intend to type the code as I read the book:

- "Numerical Recipes in Fortran, The Art of Scientific Computing", by William H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling and Brian P. Flanney. Cambridge University Press 1992. Second Edition.

I am learning Modern Fortran as well with this exercise. Even though the code of the book is mainly Fortran77, I have been using other newer books and sources to get the code working in modern fortran, the standards since Fortran90.

Special thanks to the developers of ChatGPT. It is being a great tool on top of "Googling" terms, to navigate through sparse documentations, and solution of technical issues. Also a very fun way of learning, it feels like peer programming.

To the best of my understanding, I am not infringing any copyright of the Code. My interpretation of it is that as long as what I do is more that a textual copy or the original code, it is considered a new production.

## My contributions

This is a personal notebook of my journey through the topic in one side, but as a usable piece of software in the other side. I intent to learn by experience to be a better programmer, and to develop solid craftmanship in software engineering. So I set from the beginning this repository with what I could see as basic infrastructure for the journey. 

- The unit tests of the functions are my contribution, I did not order nor plan to use the 'diskette drivers' mentioned in the book.

- Additionally I plan to check the properties of the algorithms and further 'play' with them for fun, by coding and running the suggested benchmarks, and expand on related topics as I go.

- I will keep the book chapters structure in the source organization, I would create a subfolder for each chapter, with a module in it containing the code presented in that chapter. It seams that there where no modules in Fortran77 yet.

- The names of variables and interfaces would be documented using modern style, declaring each dummy argument with its intent and other attributes.

- If you happen to be studying the book as well, don't hesitate to join coding and discussing. Learning in groups is beneficial. If you have done the journey already and spot problems in my code, your feedback is appreciated.

- At the time of this writting I have processed the material of the first chapter, preeliminaries, and spend the time and effort to setup the repository with its testing and documentation infrastructure. As the journey goes further, I plan to make releases of the library. 

- I plan to compare my implementations of the discussed algorithms with available implementations for didactical purposes as well, and see the evolution of the field after the publication of the book.

- I would also add short notes when necesary summarizing the results of the benchmarks and documenting my insights.

Thank you for reading.
